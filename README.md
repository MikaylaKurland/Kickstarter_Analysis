# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This is an analysis of Kickstarter funding for theater productions in the US. 
To complete this analysis, I looked at the data of 4,114 different Kickstarter campaigns. Of those 4,114, 671 were campaigns to fund theater productions in the US. 
61% of the campaigns to fund theater productions in the US were successful, 37% failed, and the remaining 2% are still ongoing. 
The average rate of success for Kickstarter campaigns is 53%, so theater can be considered a popular category for funding by Kickstarter's donors.

Successful kickstarter campaigns to fund plays had an average goal of  $5,048.88, as opposed to an average goal of  $10,554.21 for failed campaigns.
While this may seem to indicate that successful campaigns had lower funding goals, it should be noted that the average amounts pledged differed by a factor of 10 between failed and successful campaigns.

This indicates that there may be other reasons for the campaigns' failure than the fact that the funding goal was higher. 
The successful US theater campaigns had an average per person donation of $93.00, and an average of 63 backers. 
Failed campaigns only had an average of 8 donors to their campaigns, and excluding campaigns that had no donors and raised $0.00, the average donation for failed campaigns was only $58.00.

There may be additional factors - successful campaigns and failed campaigns had similar durations, but more campaigns failed in the winter months near December, and more campaigns were successful in the summer months near May.

However, I would suggest that the higher donation amount and higher donor numbers for successful projects is due mostly to blurbs, incentives, and advertising. 

I have highlighted fifteen campaigns in the "Successful US Kickstarters" tab that have the same fundraising goal as "Fever" so you can see the blurbs the authors included.
